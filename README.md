How It Works
1. The user enters a city name.
2. The app fetches geographic coordinates using the Open-Meteo Geocoding API.
3. Weather data is retrieved based on latitude and longitude.
4. The UI updates dynamically with current, hourly, and daily forecasts.
5. Users can switch measurement units without reloading the page.

Built With

- React (Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
- Vite for fast development and build
- Open-Meteo API (no API key required)
- Vanilla CSS (custom design, no UI libraries)
